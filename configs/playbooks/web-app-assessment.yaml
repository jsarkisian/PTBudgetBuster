description: "Assess a web application — HTTP fingerprinting, directory discovery, crawling, vulnerability scanning, and SSL/TLS analysis"
category: web
approval_default: manual
builtin: true

phases:
  - name: "HTTP Fingerprinting"
    goal: "Probe the target web application for status codes, technologies, server headers, and WAF detection."
    tools_hint: ["httpx", "whatweb", "wafw00f"]
    max_steps: 2
  - name: "Directory & File Discovery"
    goal: "Brute-force common directories and files on the target web server. Look for admin panels, backup files, and hidden endpoints."
    tools_hint: ["ffuf", "gobuster"]
    max_steps: 3
  - name: "Web Crawling"
    goal: "Crawl the target application to discover endpoints, URLs, and JavaScript files. Include JS parsing for hidden API endpoints."
    tools_hint: ["katana", "gospider"]
    max_steps: 2
  - name: "Vulnerability Scanning"
    goal: "Run vulnerability scans focused on web application issues — XSS, SQLi, misconfigurations, exposed panels, and known CVEs."
    tools_hint: ["nuclei", "nikto"]
    max_steps: 3
  - name: "SSL/TLS Analysis"
    goal: "Analyze the target's SSL/TLS configuration for weak ciphers, expired certificates, and protocol vulnerabilities."
