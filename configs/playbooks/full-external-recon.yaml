phases:
  - name: "Subdomain Enumeration"
    goal: "Discover all subdomains of the target domain using passive sources. Save results to a file for use in later phases."

    max_steps: 3
  - name: "DNS Resolution & Records"
    goal: "Resolve discovered subdomains to IP addresses and enumerate DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, NS, CNAME, TXT). Identify any interesting DNS misconfigurations."

  - name: "HTTP Probing"
    goal: "Probe discovered hosts for live web servers. Identify status codes, page titles, technologies, and server headers."
    tools_hint: ["httpx", "whatweb"]
    max_steps: 2
  - name: "Port Scanning"
    goal: "Scan discovered hosts for open ports and identify running services with version detection."
    tools_hint: ["naabu", "nmap"]
    max_steps: 2
  - name: "Vulnerability Scanning"
    goal: "Run vulnerability scans against discovered web services using template-based scanning. Focus on medium, high, and critical severity."
