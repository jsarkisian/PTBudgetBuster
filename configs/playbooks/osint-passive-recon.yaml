category: reconnaissance
approval_default: auto
builtin: true

phases:
  - name: "Subdomain Enumeration"
    goal: "Discover subdomains using passive sources only. Do not perform any active scanning or brute-forcing."
    tools_hint: ["subfinder", "amass"]
    max_steps: 2
  - name: "OSINT Harvesting"
    goal: "Harvest emails, names, subdomains, and IPs from public sources like search engines and certificate transparency logs."
    tools_hint: ["theharvester"]
    max_steps: 2
  - name: "Historical URL Discovery"
    goal: "Collect known URLs from the Wayback Machine, Common Crawl, and other archives. Look for interesting endpoints and old pages."
    tools_hint: ["gau", "waybackurls"]
    max_steps: 2
  - name: "DNS Records"
    goal: "Enumerate DNS records for the target domain — A, AAAA, MX, NS, CNAME, TXT, SOA. Look for misconfigurations."
    tools_hint: ["dnsx", "dnsrecon", "fierce"]
    max_steps: 2
  - name: "TLS Certificate Analysis"
    goal: "Analyze TLS certificates for the target's hosts. Look for SANs, expired certs, mismatched names, and certificate transparency data."
    tools_hint: ["tlsx", "sslscan"]
    max_steps: 2
